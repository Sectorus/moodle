# Opencast API #

This tool provides API functions as well as general settings for the different opencast tools:
* [block_opencast](https://github.com/unirz-tu-ilmenau/moodle-block_opencast)
* [filter_opencast](https://github.com/unirz-tu-ilmenau/moodle-filter_opencast)
* [repository_opencast](https://github.com/unirz-tu-ilmenau/moodle-repository_opencast)

The tool stores the relation between courses and series ids and 
offers webservice endpoints for the opencast role provider. 

## Settings ##

Here the general settings for the connection to your opencast server can be set.
Required are the server and the API user.

Make sure that the API user you define here has the necessary access rights in opencast to actually access the API endpoints for *events*, *groups* and *series*.

Additionally, you can define a timeout for the connection.
